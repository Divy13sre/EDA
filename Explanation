Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and patterns related to passenger survival. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the dataset is explored through statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic passenger manifest, which includes features such as:
- Passenger demographics (Age, Sex)
- Ticket class (Pclass)
- Fare paid
- Survival status (Survived)

## Steps in the EDA
1. Data Loading 
   Loading the dataset using Pandas.

2. Data Inspection 
   Checking the structure, column types, missing values, and summary statistics.

3. Univariate Analysis 
   Visualizing distributions of numeric features (Age, Fare) using histograms and boxplots.

4. Bivariate Analysis 
   Exploring relationships between features, such as survival rates by sex and class using barplots.

5. Correlation Analysis 
   Generating correlation matrices and pairplots to understand feature relationships.

6. Insights 
   Highlighting important patterns and trends, like higher survival rates for females and first-class passengers.

## Tools and Libraries
